# Pygame-2048
A recreation of the popular game 2048 using pygame
## How to use
1. Download dependacies
2. Simply run the python file
## The Ai
The program comes with two modes of Ai. Ai1, which is activated by pressing the 1 key, plays the game almost how a human does.
It tries to keep the largest tile at the top left and only press the left and up keys. This Ai is extremely fast, however, it doesnt
perform very well, barley ever reaching 2048. Ai2 however, reaches 2048 about 80% of the time, although takes much longer, about 3 mins.
The settings of Ai2 can be changed to adjust the speed and skill however the defualts in my opinion are the best. This Ai is activated by pressing 2. To stop the Ai press 0.
## Ai2 example
This video has been sped up, showing a standard game using Ai2.
Ai2 uses Monte-Carlo (MC) Move Evaluation to determine the best next move.

## What Have I learnt?
With this new project I really tried to improve on my last pygame project, noughts and crosses (NAC or X's and O's). In my opinion 2048 is a more complex game so being able to produce a working version of the game with less bugs then NAC in by far less lines of code shows my improvement over the last few months. I atribute this to my increased awareness of more complex python functions, such as "enumerate" and classes, allowed me to make more clean and efficient code. Although my code of course isn't perfect, it's real improvement. Additionally I am quite impressed with my speed with this project compared to NAC, taking only 1 day to plan and create compared to the week and so for NAC. Although no new modules were learnt on this project, i think my general skills improved drastically.
